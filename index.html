    <title>Interactive Guide to Think and Grow Rich</title>
    
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Golden Wisdom -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a guided journey through Napoleon Hill's philosophy, broken into four thematic sections: The Foundation (mindset), The Blueprint (action), The Mastery (amplification), and Overcoming Fear (fortification). A new 'Quiz' section is added for interactive assessment. This thematic structure, rather than a linear chapter-by-chapter list, is chosen for usability because it groups related concepts, helping the user understand the philosophy as an integrated system. Key interactions include an interactive process-flow diagram on the hero section to visualize the entire system, clickable cards for each principle that reveal detailed summaries, a dynamic radar chart for the 'Six Ghosts of Fear', and a comprehensive quiz system with chapter-specific and full-book options. This approach transforms passive reading into active exploration and provides direct comprehension testing. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: The 13 interconnected principles. Goal: Visualize the entire success system. Viz/Presentation: Interactive process flow diagram built with HTML/CSS. Interaction: Hover to highlight, click to navigate. Justification: Provides a holistic overview that's more intuitive than a simple list. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        2. Report Info: The Six Ghosts of Fear. Goal: Present the core obstacles in an engaging way. Viz/Presentation: Radar chart. Interaction: Hover over points to see details. Justification: Transforms a static list into a memorable, data-viz style graphic. Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).
        3. Report Info: Detailed chapter summaries (text). Goal: Present dense text without overwhelming the user. Viz/Presentation: Click-to-expand accordion-style sections. Interaction: Click to toggle visibility. Justification: Manages information density and promotes focused learning. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        4. Report Info: Chapter content and overall themes. Goal: Assess user comprehension. Viz/Presentation: Multiple-choice quiz interface. Interaction: Select answers, submit, view score and pass/fail. Justification: Direct, interactive assessment for learning reinforcement. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
